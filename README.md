# BotRace.cs
A clone of my earlier Python Program called Botrace. Simulates bots on a 1 km track. This project is designed as a simple example of what you can do with multithreading and makes a good tutorial program. Utilizes the RandomName class contained in the RandomNameGenerator Project, another of my Github Repositories
In order to run this program, install .NET 6.0 if it's not already installed, open command prompt, terminal, or powershell, navigate to the directory where you extract the folder with the .csproj file using cd path/of/directory, then type "dotnet run", then enter.
